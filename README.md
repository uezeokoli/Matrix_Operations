Files:

1. List.h:
    header file which is used to declare functions and construct the ADTs Node and List
2. List.c:
    C source file which is used to define the declared functions and incoporates the List and Node ADT
3. ListTest.c 
    C sourse fule which is used to determine if defined functions in List.c are working as expected
4. Matrix.h
    header file which is used to declare functions and construct the Matrix and Entry ADT
5. Matrix.c
    C source file which is used to define the declared functions and incoporates the Matrix, List, and Entry ADT
6. MatrixTest.c:
    C source file which is used to determine if defined functions in Matrix.c are working as expected
7. Sparse.c:
    C source file which takes two command line arguments(input file to read and name for output file) and reads the input file to initialiaze two matrices. This file also is responsible for outputting the result of matrix operations of the two matrices
8. Makefile:
    makefile which compiles code and creates executables Sparse, MatrixTest, and ListTest. Can also check for memory errors in Sparse, MatrixTest, and ListTest with command SparseCheck, MatrixCheck, and ListCheck.
